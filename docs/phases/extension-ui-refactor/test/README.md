# Phase 4B - Extension UI Refactor (Test)

Decision: Automated tests skipped for this iteration (manual validation only).

Manual tests executed:
- Overlay Home auto-opens on Topstep/TradingView; toggle persists.
- New Conversation creates and loads a session; Continue Chat resumes last active session.
- Chat round-trip to `/ask` returns and renders; loading states and error toasts verified.
- Open App button launches `/app` in a new tab.
- Resize/move overlay; persistence and Reset Size verified.
- Visual review: black/yellow theme; animations on hover/press and entry transitions.
- Layout: header/input/footer fixed; messages area fills remaining space with no bottom gap.

Known deferrals:
- Quick Context right pane (KPIs, session switcher) to be implemented in next iteration.
