# Feature Plans

This folder contains all feature plans created during the development process.

## Purpose

Each plan document serves as:
- **Contract** between user and developer on what will be built
- **Reference** during implementation to stay on track
- **Reminder** of original deliverables when testing/fixing bugs
- **Documentation** of what was planned vs. what was built

## Structure

Plans are organized by feature/phase and named with:
- Date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Feature name
- Optional phase number

Example: `2025-11-04-feature-name-phase-1.md`

## Plan Template

Each plan should include:

1. **Feature Overview**
   - What it does
   - Why it's needed
   - User story

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Backend changes
   - Frontend changes
   - Database changes
   - API endpoints
   - Dependencies

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Architecture approach
   - File structure
   - Component breakdown

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test scenarios
   - Success criteria
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling

5. **Deliverables**
   - Final output
   - Acceptance criteria
   - What "done" looks like

## Usage

- **Before implementation**: Reference the plan to understand requirements
- **During implementation**: Check plan to ensure you're on track
- **During testing**: Compare actual behavior vs. plan deliverables
- **When fixing bugs**: Remember what the original goal was

## Important Notes

- Plans are **living documents** - can be updated if needed (with discussion)
- Plans serve as **contract** - don't deviate without approval
- Plans help **prevent scope creep** - stay focused on original goals
- Plans reduce **forgetting deliverables** - always know what was originally planned

**Remember:** When you're deep in testing and fixing bugs, come back to this folder to remember what the original feature was supposed to do!
