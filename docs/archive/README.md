# Archive (Legacy/Reference)

Items in this folder were moved from the root docs to declutter the active workspace. They are kept for reference and can be restored if needed.

Moved here:
- LATV2_REMOVAL_PROGRESS.md
- SELF_HOSTED_MODELS_EXPLANATION.md
- TEACHING_APPROACH_PROPOSAL.md
- SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-11-12.md
- VISUAL_TESTING_SUMMARY.md
- VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
- FEATURE_IDEAS.md
- ENTRY_LAB_OVERVIEW.md
- NEW_PROJECT_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md
- PHASE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md
- docs/docker/ (legacy docker notes)

If you need any of these restored to active docs, move them out of `docs/archive/`.
